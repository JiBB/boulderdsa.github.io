**Want to contact us?  Email the [Boulder DSA officers][email-officers].**

We hold meetings on alternate Thursdaysâ€”check [the calendar]({% link calendar.md %}) for details.  Feel free to just show up to a meeting to see what we're about, contact us [by email][email-officers] if you'd like, or [join our email list][mailing-list-signup].  You can also start by getting in touch with a working group that interests you:

* [Housing Justice][email-housing]
* [Medicare for All][email-m4a]
* [Outreach][email-outreach]
* [CU YDSA][email-ydsa]

You're free to come by and check out our meetings, but if you'd like to officially join the Boulder chapter, you'll need to join and become a [dues paying member](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership/) of the national [DSA](http://www.dsausa.org) organization.


If you have experienced discrimination, harassment or bullying from someone in the DSA, please contact our [Harassment Grievance Officers][email-hgo].
