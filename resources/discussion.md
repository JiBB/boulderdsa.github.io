title: Expectations For Respectful Discussion
---

_Summarized from the [DSA National guidelines](http://www.dsausa.org/respectful_discussion)._

#### Assume good faith in your fellow comrades
*  Speak from experience, speak for yourself.
*  Clarify before challenging others.
*  Challenge oppressive behaviors, but call each other "in", rather than call each other out.

#### Know whether you need to "step up" or "step back"
*  Create a safe and inclusive space for everybody.
*  Avoid dominating the conversation, respect the facilitator.
*  If you don't often speak up, we encourage you to do so!

#### Please ask yourself "Why am I Talking?" (WAIT)
*  Has what you want to say already been said?
*  Is this on topic?
*  Is there a better time and place to say it, or another way, such as nodding your head, of expressing your opinion?

#### Please recognize and respect others feelings, background, and cultural differences
*  Don't use language that's oppressive or hurtful.
*  Refrain from using acronyms or complicated language that could exclude others.

#### We have “one mic” so do not interrupt or speak while others are talking
*  This is basic politeness.

#### Respect the facilitator when they use Progressive Stack
*  Raise your hand if you want to speak, then put it down when the facilitator acknowledges you.
*  You will be called on in an order determined by how recently and often you've talked, and whether or not you are a member of a marginalized group.

#### Be comradely and have fun
* Who said movement building can't be fun?
* We need to create a culture that is not only sustainable, but restorative, to win.
* Keep criticisms constructive and impersonal.
