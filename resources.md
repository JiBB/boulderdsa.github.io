If you're attending one of our meetings, you should be aware of our [expectations for respectful discussion]({% link resources/discussion.md %}) and our [anti-harassment guidelines]({% link resources/harassment.md %}). (Also, see the [national resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PXU8_0eKmPG_8GSVVyHurorNcNPOQN_mq-mAdCOUao/edit) on harassment grievances.)

Some external resources we suggest you check out:
* We're a chapter of the national [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org).
* You can also check out what our neighboring chapter, the [Denver DSA](https://www.denverdsa.org) is doing.
* Want an introduction to what socialism is all about? Check out [The ABCs of Socialism](https://s3.jacobinmag.com/issues/jacobin-abcs.pdf).
* For more leftist news and discussion, try reading [Jacobin magazine](https://www.jacobinmag.com/).
